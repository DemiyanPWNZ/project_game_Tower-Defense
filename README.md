This project is a tower defense game.
The main library used when writing the project was pygame, math, time, os and others were also used
I also had to work with OOP and its main features.
There are bugs in the game that haven't been fixed yet.

in the game I tried to make a system of improvements and the purchase of towers
towers are also divided into supporting and attacking
